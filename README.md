üöÄ Mars Rover Kinematics and Dynamics Simulation (Rocker-Bogie vs. Solid Axle)A comprehensive MATLAB simulation analyzing the comparative kinematics and dynamics of Rocker-Bogie and Solid Axle rover suspensions during obstacle traversal. The analysis focuses on critical performance metrics like chassis pitch angle and front wheel vertical force distribution, providing a detailed look at chassis stability under load.üìù Project FilesFile NameDescriptionRockerBogieKinematics.mThe main MATLAB script containing the simulation logic, helper functions, and visualization of the three traversal phases.LICENSE(Recommended) A standard license (e.g., MIT) to define usage permissions..gitignore(Recommended) A file to ignore MATLAB-specific files like .asv, .m~, and project files.üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the SimulationPrerequisitesMATLAB: Ensure you have MATLAB installed (R2018a or later is recommended).Toolboxes: The script requires the Optimization Toolbox for the fsolve function used in the Rocker-Bogie kinematic analysis.ExecutionDownload: Clone this repository or download the RockerBogieKinematics.m file.Open: Launch MATLAB and open the RockerBogieKinematics.m script.Run: Click the Run button in the MATLAB editor, or type RockerBogieKinematics in the Command Window.The script will execute the three-phase simulation and automatically display the resulting figure, showing the rover configuration at the three critical points of obstacle traversal.‚öôÔ∏è Key ParametersThe physical parameters of the rover and obstacle can be easily modified in SECTION 1 of the MATLAB script:ParameterVariableDefault ValueDescriptionWheel DiameterL_wd0.5 mDiameter of the rover wheels.Rocker LengthL_r0.72 mLength of the main rocker link.Wheel Center SpacingL_span0.8 mHorizontal distance between wheel centers (F-M and M-R).Obstacle HeightH_obs0.3 mThe height of the step obstacle to be traversed.üìö Simulation MethodologyRocker-Bogie KinematicsThe Rocker-Bogie system's movement is solved using an Inverse Kinematics approach based on two fundamental distance constraints for the chassis pivot point ($P'$):$$\begin{align*}
\text{Constraint 1: } & ||P' - M'||^2 = L_r^2 \\
\text{Constraint 2: } & ||P' - F'||^2 = L_{PF}^2
\end{align*}$$Where:$P'$ is the chassis pivot point.$M'$ and $F'$ are the centers of the middle and front wheels, respectively.$L_r$ is the Rocker Link length.$L_{PF}$ is the fixed distance between the chassis pivot $P'$ and the front wheel pivot $F'$.The MATLAB fsolve function is used to numerically determine the coordinates of $P'$ that satisfy these two non-linear equations in each phase.Traversal PhasesThe simulation breaks the obstacle traversal into three critical phases:Phase 1 (F up): The front wheel ($F'$) is on top of the step, while the middle ($M'$) and rear ($R'$) wheels are on the ground.Phase 2 (M up): The front and middle wheels ($F'$ and $M'$) are on the step, and the rear wheel ($R'$) is on the ground.Phase 3 (R up): All three wheels ($F', M', R'$) have successfully climbed and are now resting on the top of the step.
